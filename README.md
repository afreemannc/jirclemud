# MudJS

MudJS is an extensible text based multi-user dungeon engine based loosely on the old Circle and Diku mud engines.

## Project goals

- Provide an easily extensible MUD engine that will run on commodity hosting.
- Make sharing zones and other customizations across MUDs simple via a module import/export system.
- Provide flexible APIs to support customizations to game mechanics with a minimum of code.
- Learn me some NodeJS


## Installation

- Create a database for the MUD to use (see [sequelize docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) for more details on supported databases)
- Clone this repo to a working directory
- Copy config/config.example.js to config.js
- Edit config.js, change database settings as needed.
- Run 'npm install'. This will download required npm packages and initialize the database tables.

## Features

- Full color terminal support
- Modular design for easy customization
- Supports realtime world building
