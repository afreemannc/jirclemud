# MudJS

MudJS is an extensible text based multi-user dungeon engine based loosely on the old Circle and Diku mud engines.

Project goals:
- Provide an easily extensible MUD engine that will run on commodity hosting.
- Make sharing zones and other customizations across MUDs simple via a module import/export system.
- Provide flexible APIs to support customizations to game mechanics with a minimum of code.
- Learn me some NodeJS
